# Homework 10.

For this week's homework I worked on my own for the first two parts of the homework (finding the date of the big drop and finding the stations with the highest drop or gain in popularity) for the second task I compared results with Julián Ferreiro to make it look better.

For the third part of the homework I had some issues understanding the Fourier's concept properly, for which I looked for help from Julián, Chun-Chieh Tsai and Ben Steers. With their help I could improve my understanding of this task and do the third task.
