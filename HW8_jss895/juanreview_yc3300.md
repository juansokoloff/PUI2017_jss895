### CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?

The plot is comfortable to read, though I am a bit confused by the necessity of using two different colors to seperate Manhattan and other boroughs of New York City. It seems that this plot is trying to analyze the relationship between the GHG Co2 emissions and the Energy Use Intensity in New York City. If Juan is also trying to investigate difference between boroughs, it would be more helpful to list all five boroughs instead of Manhattan and others. 

### ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

The choice of colors is approprite for this plot if Juan is trying to distinguish solely between Manhattan and other boroughs, though I would want to see more contradicting colors to see more clearly which is Manhattan and which is others. It's a bit hard to tell in the center clustering part. The graphical elements is appropriate to represent the quanities being visualized, it's clear to see which circle is larger which is smaller, therefore correspondingly which one has a higher rating score which has lower. The graphical choice is not too distracting, but as said earlier, I do not see why it's necessary to seperate boroughs for relationship between CO2 emission and EUI. 

### HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
The plot honestly reproduce the data without emphasizing any point.
