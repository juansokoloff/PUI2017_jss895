# For this assignment I worked with Julián Ferreiro and received hel also from Jack Lunquist

For the first assignment we worked together with Julián specially for the K means clustering, after that when moving to the second clustering technique (Gaussian Mixture) I received help from Jack.

For the second assignment I used the notebooks developed in class with Julián and Jack.
