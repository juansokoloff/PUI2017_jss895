# First part of homework 9 (graphs review

For homework 1 I worked alone (as requested) and did all three graphs, they are found as in separate files in this folder, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.

# Second part of Homework 9

For the second part of the homework I worked mainly with Julián Ferreiro, also receiving some input from Rebecca and Prince. At first we had some troubles with the plotting, but we managed to do it with Prince's help. For the extracredit 2, Julián plotted a new meassurement, but I did not agreed because the main issue is that in the areas where you have a lot of NYC Link points you don't find a lot of inhabbitants but you do find a lot of floating population during the day. This data was not available in the census (at least as far as I searched), so I decided not to create a new measurement that was not that useful.
